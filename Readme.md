Solvent.vim
===========

Let's you use Visual Studio solutions from Vim. The solution structure is displayed in a tree similar to NERDTree but with the contents of the solution's file hierarchy.

## Requirements

 * Vim 7.4 (not yet tested with other versions)
 * Python support compiled into Vim

## Status

 * **Not ready for use yet but will be soon**
 * Shows the solution/projects structure on a side window and let's you explore it

## Roadmap
 * ~~Read sln~~ (Only tested with VS 2010 .sln files for now)
 * ~~Read C++ .vcxproj and related .filter~~ (Only tested with VS 2010 format for now)
 * ~~Key mapping system~~
 * Actually open files in project
 * Tree coloring
 * Persist status in some kind of "solvent.suo" (?) file
 * Editing of the project/solution (adding/removing files)
 * Item properties
